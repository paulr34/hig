Hockey Interview Generator

This is a simple node app that will generate a random hockey interview. Now updated to produce an actual interview with some random player from some random team. Also updated to actually speak the interview through the speakers or run as a webserver.

Usage:
> npm start //starts the server
> npm test //output to the command line
> npm run speak //speaks through the speakers (only tested on Mac)
